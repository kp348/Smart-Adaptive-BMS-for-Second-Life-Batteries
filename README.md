IEEE Hack -Smart Adaptive BMS for Second-Life Batteries

This repository contains the schematic for the **Battery Monitoring System (BMS)** designed using **KiCad** as part of the IEEE Hack project.
Our idea is To monitor the real-time status of a battery (voltage, current, temperature, state of charge) and protect it from overcharging, 
deep discharging, overheating, or short circuits â€” thereby extending its life and ensuring safety.
A battery monitoring system is needed due to following reasons:
1. Safety
   Prevents hazards like fire or explosion by shutting off the battery during overcharge, over-discharge, or over-temperature.
2. Performance
  Ensures batteries operate within safe and optimal limits, maximizing their efficiency.
3. Longevity
  Avoids deep discharge or high-temperature stress, extending the batteryâ€™s lifespan.
4. Data Monitoring
  Enables users (or systems) to track battery health, usage cycles, and predict failures.

The battery monitoring system can be used in :
Electric Vehicle
Robots
Drones
Li-ion batteries appliactions

  Steps to run the project:
  1. Follow the README instructions.
  2. Open IEEE Hack.pdf to get access to the schematic.
     Component	                        Purpose
      ESP32-WROOM-32	                  Main controller
      INA219	                        Measures battery voltage and current
      LM35 or NTC Thermistor	         Measures battery temperature
      TP4056	                        Lithium-ion charger (with status pins)
      IRLZ44N	                        Controls load via MOSFET switching
      MicroSD Card Module	            Logs data to SD card
      Battery	                        Second-life Lithium-ion cell
  3. Follow the code given in IEEE.ino and use it in Arduino IDE.
  4. Open Arduino IDE :
     Go to Tools > Board > ESP32 Dev Module
     Select the correct COM port under Tools > Port
  5.  Install Required Libraries
      Install these via Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries:
      Adafruit INA219
      WiFi
      SD
      SPI
      WebServer (comes with ESP32 package)
  6. Upload code in IEEE.ino to ESP32
  7. Open Serial Monitor to get the IP address.
  8.  Set Your Wi-Fi Credentials
      In the .ino file, update:
      const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
      const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
  9.  Once ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi, it prints its IP and open that IP in ypur browser.
  10. The real time data from ESP32 will be seen in the web page linked to repo(index.html).
